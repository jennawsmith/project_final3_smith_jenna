### Resources

[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11907053/how-do-i-add-something-to-my-html-using-javascript-without-erasing-the-whole-pag)
I used this resource to help with my javascript adding content to the page. I learned that I had to put it in a div and call it with that div's id.

[Stack Overflow Again](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19355823/jquery-click-image-open-in-full-size-click-again-closes)
This one was to help with my custom jquery - I used the attr as they did in this example to change the widths of my images when clicked.

Other than that, I did not use any resources outside of my notes and lectures.

### Comments

I am so proud with how much I've learned in this class! Thank you for a great semester!

Javascript Explanations:
Backstretch can be found on each page with the brick background.

The Responsive tabs can be found on the menu page, used for the menu.

The jquery function that I made is used on the index page in the specials section - when clicking on an image, it increases in size.

The javascript function adds "Please leave us a review" to the bottom of the contact page.
